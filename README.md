The files in this repository were created and modified by me, and retired by [FreeZeroDays](https://github.com/FreeZeroDays) and [criggs666](https://github.com/criggs626/) and  for my own personal use and come with no guarantee to work for you. I provide these files "as-is" and offer no support whatsoever to get them working. A lot of these files use terrible formatted and layered tables, anyone working with email and newsletter designs knows how painful they can be, and how worse it is to reverse-engineer those.
